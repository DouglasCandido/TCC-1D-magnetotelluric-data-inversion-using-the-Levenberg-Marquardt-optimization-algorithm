# TCC-1D-magnetotelluric-data-inversion-using-the-Levenberg-Marquardt-optimization-algorithm
In this study, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to perform the magnetotelluric data inversion, it works out by adjusting the model and minimizing the misfit between the MT data observed in the field and the data calculated by the forward modeling technique.
